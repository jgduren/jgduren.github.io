<h3 id="history">The History of Gingersnap Cookies</h3>
	<h4>Origins</h4>
		<p>Ginger is derived from the ginger root and is native to parts of South Asia; historians believe it was first cultivated in India. Ginger was prized for its valuable effects on health and imported for its medicinal uses before it was utilized for cooking purposes. Ginger found its way to ancient Rome, then to Africa and the Caribbean. In medieval times, ginger was imported to Europe in preserved form to be used in baking treats such as cakes and cookies.</p>

		
	<h4>Gingersnaps in Europe</h4>
		<p>Gingersnaps have a long history in England and Germany. The cookies were made using molasses as a sweetener rather than refined sugar because it was less expensive. As England expanded its colonial rule, it brought many of its cooking and baking traditions to these colonized countries. European settlers in the American colonies continued baking ginger snaps, bringing the necessary ingredients, including preserved and powdered ginger, with them.</p>

	<h4>Gingersnaps in America</h4>
		<p>European and British food traditions continued even after Americans gained their independence from Britain. Recipes that had been passed down, such as the traditional molasses and ginger recipe for snaps, continued to be used. Gingersnaps commonly are baked around the holidays.</p>
		
	<h4>Ways to Serve Gingersnaps</h4>
		<p>Ginger naps are served as holiday treats but they may accompany tea and coffee. Colonial tea services included light bites to eat such as cucumber sandwiches, small cakes and cookies such as gingersnaps. The spiciness of the ginger and the richness of molasses pairs well with tea or coffee. Gingersnaps also serve as garnishes in other baking recipes.</p>

<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>

<ol>

<li>Set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and spices in a bowl; stir well to mix.</li> 


<li>In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together on medium speed the butter and sugar for about 5 minutes until very light, fluffy and whitened. Add the egg and continue beating until smooth.Lower speed and beat in half the dry ingredients, then the molasses. Stop the mixer and scrape down bowl and beater. Beat in the remaining dry ingredients. Remove bowl from mixer and use a large rubber spatula to finish mixing the dough.</li>

<li>Use a small ice cream scoop to scoop out 1-inch diameter pieces of dough. Roll into balls between the palms of your the hands, then roll in the sugar. Place the balls of dough on the prepared pans leaving about 3 inches all around each, to allow for spreading.  </li>

<li>Bake the cookies for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until they have spread, the surface has crackled, and they are firm to the touch. Slide the papers from the pans to racks. Store the cooled cookies between sheets of parchment or waxed paper in a tin or platic container witha tight-fitting cover.</li>
