<h3 id="persona">Target Audience</h3>
<p>The persona of my audience is most likely a friend of mine, the age range is probably from 17-30 years old. Most of the people looking <br>
at my page are going to be fellow college students with a few exceptions. Though my friends are probably not interested in my professional endeavors<br>
I am hoping to develop this page into something that I can use in the future with potential employers. At that time my target audience will be <br>
vastly different. 
</p>

<h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>

<p>Here are my favorite personal sites:</p>

			  
			   <p><a href="http://www.kristagray.com/" title="Krista Gray">Krista Gray</a><br>
			   	Gray's page is attractive because of it's simple yet efficient design. I like that it looks professional but that it's still easy <br>
			   	to navigate. I am curious as to how you can insert links in the top corner rather than the middle of the page.
			   	
			   </p>
			   <p><a href="http://www.sarahlichang.com/" title="Sarah Chang">Sarah Chang</a><br>
			   Sarah Chang's page is aesthetically similar to Krista Gray's. Both are very simple but informative. I like that there is a simple color<br>
			   scheme and that the text is centered. I also like that Sarah has links to different institutions she is affiliated with at the bottom of the page.
			   	
			   </p>
			   <p><a href="http://ianenders.com/" title="Ian Enders">Ian Enders</a><br>
			   	Ian Enders' page is one that I wish I could call my own. Not only are you able to able to experience his quirkiness, but his page<br>
			   	is efficient and interesting.I enjoy the quick intersting facts and career acheivements rather than a long narrative. I am not sure <br>
			   	how employers outside of a creative field would respond to this page, but I love it.
			   </p>
			   <p><a href="http://www.callieschweitzer.com/"title="Callie Schweitzer">Callie Schweitzer</a> <br>
			   	I enjoy Schweitzer's page because of the clean layout and the formatting of the text in the center of the page. The text looks clean and <br>
			   	magically frames her picture. I would like to figure out how to format images like this on my personal site. 
			   </p>
			   <p><a href="http://www.allisonstadd.com/"title="Allison Stadd">Allison Stadd</a><br>
			   	I like Stadd's page because it feels fun, creative, and personal. Having the image of the typewriter in the background gives you some insight<br>
			   	into her career and exudes creativity. This page is still simple, but the friendly text and scrolling font keep this page different and inviting <br>
			   	to it's visitors.
